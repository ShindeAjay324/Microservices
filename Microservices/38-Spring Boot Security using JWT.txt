==============================

1) User Register
   => Read data as JSON From POSTMAN and Store in DB


2) User Login and Token Generation
=> Define JWT Token service to generate token after login success

3) Token validation and Service
=> Check Auth Header using Filter and validate using JwtUtil.
	if valid then continue to service/controller code.
